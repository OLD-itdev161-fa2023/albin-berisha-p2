## Description

#### The Sky-Link react event application is a web-based tool that allows users to create and manage events. 
#### I used Redux, CRUD operations and Google Maps integration. The Redux library manages its state, which is stored in a single, centralized location, and makes it easy to see how changes to the state will affect the application. The integration of Google Maps helps show maps to users and displays points of interest and the location of events.
